## A CSS preprocessor that also stylizes the sheet for easy reading

I find my CSS usually has to be readible by others, so why not beautify it at the same time?

This CSS styler both allows you to write CSS using a simpler syntax, and it beautifies the CSS as it compiles the code into CSS.


## Todo:

### Short Term

* Extend Tests Suite
* Extend Shortened Syntax

### Long Term

* Add short hand for common rules for extensibility [e.g. "bg" for "background", "bgi" for "background-image", "mt" for "margin-top", etc.]
