# css-styler

## A CSS preprocessor that also stylizes the sheet for easy reading

CSS usually has to be read by others, so why not beautify it at the same time?

This CSS styler both allows you to write CSS using a simpler syntax, and it beautifies the CSS as it compiles the code into CSS.


## Todo:

### Short Term

* Add Tests
* Fix cmd arguments (still)
* Fix the Beautify/Minify functions in ParseCSS.hs
* Add SASS like syntax
* Add SASS mixins
* Add SASS extensions
* Add SASS nesting
* Pick a language/project name

### Long Term

* Add short hand for common rules for extensibility [e.g. "bg" for "background", "bgi" for "background-image", "mt" for "margin-top", etc.]
